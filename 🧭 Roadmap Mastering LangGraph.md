# [[VANITY]]. [[LangChain Roadmap]].

A step-by-step tasklist to learn **LangGraph**, from basics to building production-ready agentic AI workflows.  
Goal: Become proficient in using LangGraph to design, debug, and deploy **agentic AI systems**.

---

## âœ… 1. Foundations
- [ ] Understand **what LangGraph is**:
  - [ ] Extension of LangChain for **stateful, multi-agent workflows**
  - [ ] Works with **graphs of nodes** (LLMs, tools, memory, routers)
  - [ ] Designed for **control + interpretability**
- [ ] Install LangGraph:
  - [ ] `pip install langgraph`
  - [ ] Set up Python venv
- [ ] Explore **LangChain basics** (if not known already):
  - [ ] Chains
  - [ ] Agents
  - [ ] Memory
  - [ ] Tools & retrievers

---

## âœ… 2. LangGraph Basics
- [ ] Understand LangGraph **core concepts**:
  - [ ] **Graph** (workflow of nodes)
  - [ ] **Node** (unit of execution)
  - [ ] **Edges** (control flow between nodes)
  - [ ] **State** (data being passed along)
- [ ] Build your **first LangGraph**:
  - [ ] Create nodes â†’ connect with edges â†’ execute
  - [ ] Visualize workflow
- [ ] Learn **synchronous vs asynchronous execution**

---

## âœ… 3. Working with State
- [ ] Understand **state management** in LangGraph
- [ ] Learn how to:
  - [ ] Pass data between nodes
  - [ ] Maintain state across iterations
  - [ ] Merge states in branching workflows
- [ ] Practice with simple workflows:
  - [ ] Question â†’ Answer
  - [ ] Input â†’ Processing â†’ Output

---

## âœ… 4. Control Flow
- [ ] Learn **branching and routing**:
  - [ ] Conditional edges (if/else flows)
  - [ ] Dynamic routing (choose path based on LLM/tool response)
- [ ] Loops & iterations:
  - [ ] Retry logic
  - [ ] Self-reflection loops
- [ ] Combine LLM + tool usage in a **directed graph**

---

## âœ… 5. Multi-Agent Workflows
- [ ] Create multiple **agents (nodes)** with different roles
- [ ] Build a **collaborative workflow**:
  - [ ] Research agent â†’ Summarizer agent â†’ Critic agent
- [ ] Explore **hierarchical workflows** (supervisor + workers)
- [ ] Implement **tool-using agents** inside LangGraph

---

## âœ… 6. Advanced Features
- [ ] **Checkpoints & persistence**:
  - [ ] Save state mid-execution
  - [ ] Resume from checkpoints
- [ ] **Human-in-the-loop**:
  - [ ] Insert manual decision nodes
  - [ ] Override agent decisions
- [ ] **Debugging & visualization**:
  - [ ] Visualize graph structure
  - [ ] Inspect node execution logs
- [ ] Error handling (timeouts, failures, retries)

---

## âœ… 7. Integrations
- [ ] Connect with **LLMs** (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)
- [ ] Integrate **retrievers/RAG** inside LangGraph nodes
- [ ] Add **tools**:
  - [ ] Web search
  - [ ] Python REPL
  - [ ] APIs (e.g., weather, finance)
- [ ] Work with **memory modules** across graphs

---

## âœ… 8. Real-World Applications
- [ ] Build an **AI research assistant** (multi-agent)
- [ ] Create a **customer support agent** with branching workflows
- [ ] Implement a **multi-step RAG pipeline**:
  - [ ] Query rewriting
  - [ ] Retriever agent
  - [ ] Synthesizer agent
- [ ] Deploy as an API (FastAPI, Flask)
- [ ] Deploy as a Streamlit UI

---

## âœ… 9. Production & Scaling
- [ ] CI/CD for LangGraph projects
- [ ] Containerization (Docker)
- [ ] Deployment to cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- [ ] Logging & monitoring of agent workflows
- [ ] Handling **concurrency & async workflows**

---

## âœ… 10. Resources
- [ ] LangGraph official docs & GitHub
- [ ] LangChain documentation
- [ ] Example notebooks from LangGraph repo
- [ ] Community tutorials & YouTube breakdowns
- [ ] Research papers on **agentic workflows** and **multi-agent systems**

---

# ðŸŽ¯ Final Goal
Be able to design, debug, and deploy **sophisticated multi-agent systems with LangGraph** â€” combining **LLMs, tools, memory, and custom workflows** with full control & transparency.
