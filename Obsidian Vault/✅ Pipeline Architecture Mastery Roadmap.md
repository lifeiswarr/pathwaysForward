# .[[VANITY]], [[🚀 CI&CD (Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment) Roadmap]], [[✅ Git & GitHub Proficiency Roadmap (Obsidian Tasklist)]]


## 🧱 1. Foundational Concepts
- [ ] Understand what a pipeline is (data → transform → output)
- [ ] Learn use cases: data pipelines, ML pipelines, ETL pipelines
- [ ] Understand batch vs streaming pipelines
- [ ] Study pipeline components: sources, processors, sinks
- [ ] Understand DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs)

## 🔁 2. Data Engineering Pipelines
- [ ] Extract data from multiple sources (APIs, DBs, files)
- [ ] Transform: data cleaning, filtering, aggregating
- [ ] Load data into storage systems (data lakes, warehouses)
- [ ] Learn ETL vs ELT strategies
- [ ] Automate jobs with cron, Airflow, or Prefect

## 🧪 3. ML Pipeline Architecture
- [ ] Ingest raw data
- [ ] Validate, clean, and preprocess data
- [ ] Feature engineering and selection
- [ ] Train model (with experiment tracking)
- [ ] Evaluate and validate model
- [ ] Package and version model
- [ ] Deploy model
- [ ] Monitor model (drift, decay, performance)

## ⚙️ 4. Tools for Building Pipelines
- [ ] Apache Airflow (orchestration)
- [ ] Prefect, Dagster (modern alternatives)
- [ ] Luigi (Python-native pipelines)
- [ ] Kubeflow Pipelines (K8s-native ML pipelines)
- [ ] MLflow (tracking + packaging)
- [ ] DVC (data + model versioning)
- [ ] TensorFlow Extended (TFX)

## 🧰 5. Containerization & Orchestration
- [ ] Dockerize each pipeline component
- [ ] Use Kubernetes for container orchestration
- [ ] Write Helm charts for deploying ML pipelines
- [ ] Scale workloads using resource quotas

## 🧬 6. Modular & Reusable Design
- [ ] Create reusable data transformation modules
- [ ] Parameterize pipeline steps (via config files)
- [ ] Handle different data types/sources with abstraction
- [ ] Use templates and code generators for common patterns

## 🛡️ 7. Versioning, Testing & CI/CD
- [ ] Version data (DVC, LakeFS) and models (MLflow, Git tags)
- [ ] Test pipeline steps (unit + integration tests)
- [ ] Create CI/CD pipelines for pipeline updates
- [ ] Use GitHub Actions / GitLab CI to automate pipeline deployment
- [ ] Track pipeline metadata and logs

## 🔍 8. Monitoring, Logging, and Observability
- [ ] Add logging to each pipeline step (`logging` module or `structlog`)
- [ ] Monitor pipeline execution time, failure rates
- [ ] Use Prometheus + Grafana for dashboards
- [ ] Track model metrics, drift, and concept decay

## 🛠️ 9. Handling Failures and Recovery
- [ ] Implement retry policies for transient failures
- [ ] Use checkpoints and idempotent steps
- [ ] Log all inputs/outputs for audit
- [ ] Use message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ) for decoupling steps

## 🌐 10. Cloud-Native Pipelines
- [ ] Build pipelines on AWS (Glue, Step Functions, SageMaker)
- [ ] Use Azure Data Factory / ML Pipelines
- [ ] Implement GCP pipelines (Dataflow, Vertex AI)
- [ ] Secure cloud pipelines (IAM, Secrets Manager, encryption)

## 🔐 11. Security & Governance
- [ ] Implement access control on pipeline components
- [ ] Secure secrets (environment vars, vaults)
- [ ] Audit logs of data transformations
- [ ] Validate PII handling, ensure compliance (GDPR, HIPAA)

## 🧠 12. Real-World Project Practice
- [ ] Build a data-to-dashboard pipeline (e.g., CSV → ETL → Dashboard)
- [ ] Build an end-to-end ML training + deploy pipeline
- [ ] Build a real-time alerting pipeline using streaming data
- [ ] Migrate an existing script to a DAG-based orchestrated pipeline
- [ ] Rebuild a broken ML pipeline using modular, production-grade tools

## 🧭 Final Review Checklist
- [ ] Can you design an end-to-end data/ML pipeline?
- [ ] Have you implemented retry, logging, and monitoring?
- [ ] Can you scale your pipeline using Docker/K8s?
- [ ] Do you track experiments, version data and automate deployment?
- [ ] Is your pipeline secure, tested, and cloud-deployable?
