- [ ] GitLab CI/CD
- [ ] CircleCI
- [ ] Travis CI
- [ ] Azure DevOps Pipelines
- [ ] Bitbucket Pipelines

## 📄 6. CI/CD Configuration Files
- [ ] Understand YAML/JSON configuration syntax
- [ ] Define jobs, steps, and workflows
- [ ] Setup environment variables
- [ ] Use secrets securely

## 🧰 7. Static Code Analysis & Quality Gates
- [ ] Linters (ESLint, Pylint, etc.)
- [ ] Code Formatters (Prettier, Black)
- [ ] Code quality tools (SonarQube, CodeClimate)
- [ ] Security scans (Snyk, Bandit, Trivy)

## 📦 8. Artifact Repositories
- [ ] Understand artifacts and how to store them
- [ ] Tools: Nexus, Artifactory, GitHub Packages, AWS CodeArtifact
- [ ] Build version tagging and semantic versioning

## 🐳 9. Containerization & Docker
- [ ] Dockerfile basics
- [ ] Building and tagging images
- [ ] Docker Compose
- [ ] Multi-stage builds
- [ ] Docker Hub / GHCR / ECR

## ☸️ 10. Deployment Tools
- [ ] Understand deployment strategies: Rolling, Blue/Green, Canary
- [ ] SSH Deployment
- [ ] Docker-based deployment
- [ ] Kubernetes-based deployment
- [ ] AWS CodeDeploy, Google Cloud Build, Azure Pipelines

## 🌍 11. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- [ ] Basics of IaC
- [ ] Tools:
  - [ ] Terraform
  - [ ] Ansible
  - [ ] Pulumi
  - [ ] CloudFormation
- [ ] Environment provisioning
- [ ] Secrets management (Vault, SSM, etc.)

## 📊 12. Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Understand observability: logs, metrics, traces
- [ ] Integrate monitoring in pipelines
- [ ] Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, Datadog

## 🧠 13. Advanced Concepts
- [ ] GitOps
- [ ] Progressive Delivery (Feature Flags, A/B Testing)
- [ ] Event-driven CI/CD
- [ ] Policy-as-code (OPA, Kyverno)

## 🔐 14. Security in CI/CD
- [ ] Secrets scanning
- [ ] Secure credential storage
- [ ] CI/CD security best practices
- [ ] SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)
- [ ] Supply chain security (e.g., SLSA, in-toto)

## 📚 15. Practice Projects
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions for a Python app
- [ ] Create a CI pipeline with Jenkins and Docker
- [ ] Use Terraform to provision infra and deploy an app
- [ ] Monitor deployment using Prometheus & Grafana
- [ ] Deploy a Node.js app with GitLab CI/CD on Kubernetes

## 🏁 16. Final Capstone
- [ ] Create an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline:
  - [ ] Code → Build → Test → Lint → Dockerize → Deploy → Monitor
- [ ] Use GitHub Actions or Jenkins
- [ ] Deploy to Kubernetes or AWS/GCP/Azure
- [ ] Setup rollback strategy
- [ ] Integrate testing, notifications, monitoring

> ✅ Keep iterating. Start with GitHub Actions for simplicity, and then move toward Jenkins, Terraform, Docker, and Kubernetes.
> 
> 🧠 Tip: Version your infrastructure, pipeline files, and code together.
