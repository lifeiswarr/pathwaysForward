## üß† Project Goal
Build a batch-processed system that scrapes LinkedIn job competitors for a given role, compares their profiles (skills + education) to a client‚Äôs profile, categorizes them into threat tiers, and sends a daily email update to the client with a summary.

---

## üìÇ 1. Project Initialization

- [ ] Set up Git repo structure (src/, data/, notebooks/, config/, logs/)
- [ ] Create Python virtual environment
- [ ] Install dependencies (requests, BeautifulSoup, Selenium, Pandas, scikit-learn, smtplib, schedule, etc.)

---

## üï∏Ô∏è 2. LinkedIn Scraper Module

- [ ] Create a `LinkedInScraper` class/module
- [ ] Implement authentication mechanism (if using cookies/session)
- [ ] Develop job search scraper (filters: title, location, company, etc.)
- [ ] Develop profile scraper for each applicant:
  - [ ] Scrape skills
  - [ ] Scrape education details
  - [ ] Scrape current job title, experience
- [ ] Store scraped data in a structured format (JSON or CSV)
- [ ] Implement scraping throttling, delay, and bot-detection bypass

---

## üìä 3. Data Processing & Feature Engineering

- [ ] Clean and normalize scraped profiles
- [ ] Vectorize:
  - [ ] Skills (using TF-IDF / embeddings)
  - [ ] Education level (assign weight/level numerically)
  - [ ] Experience (years in numeric)
- [ ] Construct competitor profiles as feature vectors

---

## üßæ 4. Client Profile Input & Comparison Engine

- [ ] Design a client profile input schema (manual JSON or form UI)
- [ ] Implement cosine similarity / nearest neighbors to find similarity between client and competitors
- [ ] Define scoring metric (e.g., skill match %, education match, total threat score)
- [ ] Assign **Threat Tiers**:
  - [ ] Tier 1: High threat (very similar, better education/skills)
  - [ ] Tier 2: Moderate threat
  - [ ] Tier 3: Low threat or irrelevant

---

## üì¶ 5. Batch Processing System

- [ ] Build job queue for scraping + processing (batch-wise)
- [ ] Schedule daily job (using `schedule` or `cron`)
- [ ] Store historical batch results (timestamped JSON)

---

## üìß 6. Email Notification System

- [ ] Create a formatted email template:
  - [ ] Include job title, number of competitors per tier
  - [ ] Include summary (e.g., 3 Tier-1, 10 Tier-2, 6 Tier-3)
- [ ] Setup email service (SMTP or API like SendGrid)
- [ ] Automate sending to client once daily after batch run

---

## üß™ 7. Evaluation & Testing

- [ ] Unit test scraping logic
- [ ] Validate similarity scoring with sample profiles
- [ ] Verify email generation and delivery
- [ ] Monitor run-time performance and edge cases

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 8. Configuration & Deployment

- [ ] Store credentials securely (.env or vault)
- [ ] Use configuration files for jobs, filters, thresholds
- [ ] Containerize app with Docker (optional)
- [ ] Deploy on server (e.g., AWS EC2, Heroku, CronJob)

---

## üìù 9. Documentation

- [ ] Project README
- [ ] How-to-run instructions
- [ ] Configuring new jobs/clients
- [ ] Interpreting email reports

---

## ‚úÖ 10. Deliverables

- [ ] Daily email report to client
- [ ] Tier-wise threat summary for target job
- [ ] Codebase with logging and error handling
- [ ] Ability to scale to multiple jobs or clients

---

## üí° Bonus Ideas (Future)

- [ ] Dashboard with live job competition monitoring
- [ ] Auto-apply for jobs where competition is low
- [ ] GPT-powered skill gap suggestions for client
```
Great! Below is both a **detailed `.yml` pipeline script** (for automation via CI/CD or scheduling tools like GitHub Actions or Airflow) and a **Jupyter notebook-compatible structure**. After that, you‚Äôll get a **detailed starter codebase template** to kick off the project.

---

# ‚öôÔ∏è 1. `.yml` Pipeline Script (CI/CD & Daily Scheduling)

This script can be used in **GitHub Actions** or adapted for **Airflow, Prefect**, or a **CronJob** on a cloud VM.

### üìÅ `.github/workflows/linkedin_competitor_notifier.yml`

```yaml
name: LinkedIn Competitor Analysis & Notifier

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 8 * * *' # Runs daily at 8:00 AM UTC
  workflow_dispatch: # Optional manual trigger

jobs:
  scrape-compare-email:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    env:
      EMAIL_USER: ${{ secrets.EMAIL_USER }}
      EMAIL_PASS: ${{ secrets.EMAIL_PASS }}

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Codebase
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Run LinkedIn Scraper
        run: python src/scraper/linkedin_scraper.py

      - name: Run Profile Comparator
        run: python src/processing/profile_matcher.py

      - name: Send Email Report
        run: python src/notifier/email_reporter.py
```

# üìì 2. Jupyter Workflow Structure

Inside a Jupyter notebook, you'd create these sections to replicate the task list manually:

```markdown
## üßæ Step 1: Load or Create Client Profile
- JSON-based profile input (skills, education, experience)

## üîç Step 2: Scrape LinkedIn Competitor Profiles
- Use Selenium or `requests` to simulate searches and extract skills, roles, education

## üìê Step 3: Preprocess and Vectorize
- TF-IDF on skills
- One-hot / level encoding of education
- Normalize experience

## üß† Step 4: Compute Similarity Scores
- Cosine similarity or Nearest Neighbors
- Calculate threat scores

## üéØ Step 5: Assign Threat Tiers
- Tier 1: Score > 0.85
- Tier 2: 0.65 - 0.85
- Tier 3: < 0.65

## üìß Step 6: Generate and Send Daily Email
- Create HTML template
- Use smtplib/sendgrid to send report
```
