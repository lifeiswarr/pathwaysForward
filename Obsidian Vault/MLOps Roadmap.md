# [[VANITY]].[[ML_Engineer_Mastery_Roadmap]].

## 1. Foundations
- [ ] Understand the ML lifecycle (development → deployment → monitoring)
- [ ] Learn software engineering best practices for ML (version control, modular code)
- [ ] Study ML model reproducibility principles
- [ ] Learn basic CI/CD concepts in ML

## 2. Data Management
- [ ] Data versioning with tools like DVC, LakeFS
- [ ] Automate data pipelines (Airflow, Prefect, Luigi)
- [ ] Data validation (Great Expectations, TFDV)

## 3. Model Training & Experimentation
- [ ] Experiment tracking (MLflow, Weights & Biases, Neptune.ai)
- [ ] Reproducible training environments (Docker, Conda)
- [ ] Distributed training techniques

## 4. Model Deployment
- [ ] Deployment strategies (batch, real-time, streaming)
- [ ] Serving frameworks (TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe, BentoML, FastAPI)
- [ ] Edge deployment considerations

## 5. Monitoring & Maintenance
- [ ] Model performance monitoring (concept drift, data drift)
- [ ] Retraining pipelines
- [ ] Alerting & logging

## 6. Infrastructure & Tools
- [ ] Kubernetes basics for ML workloads
- [ ] Cloud MLOps services (AWS Sagemaker, GCP Vertex AI, Azure ML)
- [ ] Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform, Pulumi)

## 7. Advanced Topics
- [ ] Continuous Training (CT) systems
- [ ] MLOps for Large Language Models (LLMs)
- [ ] Responsible AI & model governance
