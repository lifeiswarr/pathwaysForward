- [ ] # 🧭 Mermaid.js Roadmap – Beginner to Pro

> - [ ] Goal: Master Mermaid.js for creating flowcharts, diagrams, and dynamic visual documentation in Obsidian and beyond.

- [ ] ---

- [ ] ## 🟢 Phase 1: Getting Started with Mermaid
- What is Mermaid.js? Use cases and advantages
- Install & enable Mermaid in Obsidian:
  - Obsidian → Settings → Editor → Show Code Blocks → Enable Mermaid
- Understand basic Mermaid syntax:
  - [ ] ```mermaid
  - [ ] graph TD
    - [ ] A --> B
- [ ] ```

- [ ]  Practice writing Mermaid inside Markdown code blocks
    
- [ ]  Use Mermaid Live Editor: [https://mermaid.live/](https://mermaid.live/)
    

- [ ] ---

- [ ] ## 🟡 Phase 2: Core Diagram Types

- [ ] ### 🔹 Flowcharts (graph)

- [ ]  Understand flow directions: TD, LR, BT, RL
    
- [ ]  Define nodes, arrows, labels
    
- [ ]  Use different arrow styles: `-->`, `-.->`, `==>`
    
- [ ]  Use subgraphs for grouping
    
- [ ]  Add styles to nodes and links
    

- [ ] ### 🔹 Sequence Diagrams

- [ ]  Define participants and messages
    
- [ ]  Add `Note left/right of`
    
- [ ]  Use `opt`, `alt`, `loop`, `par`, and `activate/deactivate`
    
- [ ]  Represent async messages and self-calls
    

- [ ] ### 🔹 Class Diagrams

- [ ]  Define classes with fields and methods
    
- [ ]  Model inheritance and relationships:
    
    - [ ]  Aggregation, Composition, Association
        

- [ ] ---

- [ ] ## 🟠 Phase 3: Intermediate Diagramming Skills

- [ ]  Style nodes: fill color, stroke, font
    
- [ ]  Use `click` events for interactivity
    
- [ ]  Combine multiple diagrams in one note
    
- [ ]  Add comments using `%% ... %%`
    
- [ ]  Add links within diagrams using Markdown or HTML
    

- [ ] ---

- [ ] ## 🔵 Phase 4: Advanced Diagram Types

- [ ]  State Diagrams
    
    - [ ]  Define states, transitions, start/end
        
- [ ]  Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD)
    
    - [ ]  Define entities, fields, relationships
        
- [ ]  Gantt Charts
    
    - [ ]  Define tasks, timelines, sections, dependencies
        
- [ ]  Journey Diagrams
    
    - [ ]  Define personas, steps, feelings
        
- [ ]  Pie Charts
    
    - [ ]  Create labeled slices
        
- [ ]  Git Graphs
    
    - [ ]  Model branches, commits, merges
        

- [ ] ---

- [ ] ## 🟣 Phase 5: Customization & Theming

- [ ]  Apply global themes: `default`, `dark`, `forest`, `neutral`
    
- [ ]  Use `%%{ init: {'theme': 'forest'} }%%` for local theme
    
- [ ]  Customize theme variables (colors, font, spacing)
    
- [ ]  Control layout, spacing, arrowheads
    
- [ ]  Use Mermaid with CSS classes and IDs
    

- [ ] ---

- [ ] ## 🟤 Phase 6: Integration & Embedding

- [ ]  Embed Mermaid in:
    
    - [ ]  Obsidian (Markdown)
        
    - [ ]  Markdown Preview Enhanced (VS Code)
        
    - [ ]  Docusaurus / MkDocs
        
- [ ]  Use Mermaid with static site generators
    
- [ ]  Embed Mermaid into web pages using `<script>` + HTML
    
- [ ]  Export diagrams as SVG or PNG (from Mermaid CLI or Live Editor)
    

- [ ] ---

- [ ] ## ⚙️ Phase 7: Automation & Dynamic Diagrams

- [ ]  Generate Mermaid from:
    
    - [ ]  Python or JavaScript scripts
        
    - [ ]  YAML or JSON configuration
        
- [ ]  Use tools like:
    
    - [ ]  [Mermaid CLI](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid-cli)
        
    - [ ]  Mermaid2img, MermaidLiveAPI
        
- [ ]  Create reusable diagram templates (e.g., for systems, processes)
    
- [ ]  Integrate with project documentation pipelines

- [ ] ## 🧪 Phase 8: Real-World Projects & Use Cases

- [ ]  🧠 Draw a system architecture for a microservice application
    
- [ ]  📦 Model class structure for an API or library
    
- [ ]  🔐 Visualize an authentication state machine
